  Classical proofs of Hilbert's basis theorem, stating that
  every ideal in a polynomial ring over a field has a finite
  generating set, rely on picking a total ordering on the
  indeterminites. This need for a total ordering is even more
  pregnant in the algorithmic setting, where the decision
  procedures for the ideal membership problem (such as the
  computation of Gröbner bases) crucially depend on the
  choice of ordering on the indeterminates.
  In this paper, we provide a new proof of Hilbert's basis
  theorem that does not depend on a total ordering on the
  indeterminates, and adapt the Buchberger algorithm to
  compute Gröbner bases in this setting.
