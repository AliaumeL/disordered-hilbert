\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusion}


We wonder whether some of the results in this paper could be extended to
infinite sets of variables, such that the monomials are still
well-quasi-ordered by divisibility. This is a natural question that arises in
the context of sets with atoms, where the set of variables is infinite but are
considered up to a group of automorphisms.
