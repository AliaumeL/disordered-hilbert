\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hilbert is a fundamental theorem.
    \item adaptations to new settings (infinite number of
        variables, etc.)
    \item computational aspects (Buchberger, etc.)
    \item One key limitation in new settings is the need
        for a total ordering on the indeterminates.
        (and even then, results are non trivial)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Contributions}

New simple and self-contained proof of Hilbert's Basis Theorem
for the case of a finite number of variables, 
without the need for a total ordering on the indeterminates.

Also, adaptation of Buchberger's algorithm to the case of a
finite number of variables, without the need for a total ordering
on the indeterminates.
